# Module turtle

Run shell commands from a Kotlin script or application with ease.

Turtle simplifies the process of running external commands and processes from your Kotlin (or Java) code. It comes
with a selection of built-in functions, such as opening MacOS applications and dealing with Git. Running shell commands
easily is particularly useful from within Kotlin scripts, command line applications and Gradle tasks.
